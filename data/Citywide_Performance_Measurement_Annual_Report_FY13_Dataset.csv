On a Quarterly basis, the SDCSS produces a Performance Data Report – Comparative Data for Managing Program Performance Data which provides comparisons of each county’s performance in the data collected and which is available on-line. "," San Francisco Department of Child Support Services (SF DCSS) converted to the new California Child Support Automation System (CCSAS) from the CASES system on October 1, 2008.  For FY2009, data used to report departmental performance was based on an existing automated relationship with the CASES system.  Performance data extracted from the CASES system ceased effective September 30, 2008. Having begun conversion to CCSAS, the State has discovered calculation errors within the new system that challenge data accuracy.  The state has begun corrective action to remedy data accuracy concerns.   The data for this measure comes from Line 4 (Cell 027) and reports the number of children in IV-D cases open at the end of June on the CS1257 report generated by CCSAS to reflect the State fiscal year end measurement.  This report is run monthly and data is collected and reported on the State fiscal year.  Historical CS1257 reports are available on-line.

Investigations lead to the full Commission making a determination whether the alleged violations or not occurred. As some witnesses and/or respondents are not cooperative with staff's investigation, it is extremely difficult to predict the time necessary to resolve a complaint.","Data Collection Method and Frequency: All complaints filed with the Ethics Commission are reviewed to ascertain whether the complaint is within the Commission's jurisdiction.

These projections are based on the analysis of historical data of all the City's revenue and expenditure with current dynamics of economic growth.  On a daily basis, the Investment Division forecasts the cash requirements of the City's operation.  An example would be that every other Tuesday we are required to fund payroll of approximately $55M and to do this requires an understanding of what revenues are expected from all sources and what other disbursements will be executed on that day. The following business day the variance to forecast are analyzed to determine the appropriate adjustments (if any) to the new day's forecast.

Benchmark is set at 90% if the daily variance is within $4mm. Daily variances may appear to be more than $4mm but this does not mean that the cash flow projection model is always off since offsets for the variance sometimes occur on different days.

Though the Department's overall goal is to reduce the number of incidents of domestic violence in San Francisco, the goal of the Violence Against Women Prevention and Intervention (VAW) Grants Program is to provide services for survivors and the community at large.  Though it would seem that an increase in women accessing shelters might be a negative trend, the need in the community for crisis intervention and shelter services far outweighs the supply, and the Department considers an increase in the number of individuals served in all areas (which is related to an increase in funding for such services) to be a positive trend.
