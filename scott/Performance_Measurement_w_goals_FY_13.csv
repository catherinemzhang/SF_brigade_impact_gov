These projections are based on the analysis of historical data of all the City's revenue and expenditure with current dynamics of economic growth.  On a daily basis, the Investment Division forecasts the cash requirements of the City's operation.  An example would be that every other Tuesday we are required to fund payroll of approximately $55M and to do this requires an understanding of what revenues are expected from all sources and what other disbursements will be executed on that day. The following business day the variance to forecast are analyzed to determine the appropriate adjustments (if any) to the new day's forecast.

This money is then invested, generating additional revenue in investments.","Collection Method: Percentage of accuracy is based on the monthly average of daily cash flow variances. Benchmark is set at 90% if the daily variance is within $4mm. Daily variances may appear to be more than $4mm but this does not mean that the cash flow projection model is always off since offsets for the variance sometimes occur on different days.

This was a new measure in FY2007.  Of the individuals served by partner agencies in FY2007, 23% had a primary language other than English.  Census data shows that about 37% of San Francisco's population is foreign born, and about 46% of San Francisco's population speaks a language other than English in the home.  With language access a priority for the Department, but acknowledging limited resources, the Department hopes to show a steady growth in this measure, as seen by an increase in the percentage over time to align more closely with the City's demographics and needs.  ","Collection Method: Partner Agencies provide quarterly service reports to the Department using a standard Excel form. The form may be updated annually to enhance the reliability of the data collected. Agencies submit a separate form for each program. Department staff transfers the data into another Excel spreadsheet designed to help analyze the data. Storage: Quarterly reports are submitted electronically and/or in hard copy by agencies.
