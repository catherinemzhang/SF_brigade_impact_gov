The unemancipated children refers  to all children under the  ages of 18 or 19 if they are still  in high school, and unemancipated by Court but having the right to the child support in the IV-D caseload.  On a Quarterly basis, the SDCSS produces a Performance Data Report – Comparative Data for Managing Program Performance Data which provides comparisons of each county’s performance in the data collected and which is available on-line. "," San Francisco Department of Child Support Services (SF DCSS) converted to the new California Child Support Automation System (CCSAS) from the CASES system on October 1, 2008.  For FY2009, data used to report departmental performance was based on an existing automated relationship with the CASES system.  Performance data extracted from the CASES system ceased effective September 30, 2008. Having begun conversion to CCSAS, the State has discovered calculation errors within the new system that challenge data accuracy.  The state has begun corrective action to remedy data accuracy concerns.   The data for this measure comes from Line 4 (Cell 027) and reports the number of children in IV-D cases open at the end of June on the CS1257 report generated by CCSAS to reflect the State fiscal year end measurement.  This report is run monthly and data is collected and reported on the State fiscal year.  Historical CS1257 reports are available on-line.

Due to the growing demand for OTC services, staff resources have been shifted from reviewing the intake/submitted permits to the OTC operation.   To address this increased workload demand, the reduced staffing levels, and the growing demand for OTC services, DBI hired 10 plan review staff and one support staff during last FY.  Due to the current construction boom, DBI has received an increased number of larger, premium, and priority projects.  All projects are customer demand and it is impossible to predict the needs on a daily basis.  There is no cap on the number of permits accepted for processing. We are currently exploring the possibilities of hiring an additional engineer and a building inspector to assist with plan review.  Additionally, we have offered overtime to meet customer demands but our engineering staff is considered “Z” class employees; therefore, they do not get paid for working overtime but instead they accumulate comp time.  We have submitted a request to Human Resources to lift this requirement to allow us to meet current measures.

These projections are based on the analysis of historical data of all the City's revenue and expenditure with current dynamics of economic growth.  On a daily basis, the Investment Division forecasts the cash requirements of the City's operation.  An example would be that every other Tuesday we are required to fund payroll of approximately $55M and to do this requires an understanding of what revenues are expected from all sources and what other disbursements will be executed on that day. The following business day the variance to forecast are analyzed to determine the appropriate adjustments (if any) to the new day's forecast.  More precise cash flow projections allow the department to extract more monies from the Concentration Account.  This money is then invested, generating additional revenue in investments.","Collection Method: Percentage of accuracy is based on the monthly average of daily cash flow variances. Benchmark is set at 90% if the daily variance is within $4mm. Daily variances may appear to be more than $4mm but this does not mean that the cash flow projection model is always off since offsets for the variance sometimes occur on different days.
